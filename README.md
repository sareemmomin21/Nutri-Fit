## Environment

Create a `.env` in your `/backend` folder:

```bash
USDA_API_KEY=your_usda_api_key_here // You will need to set up the USDA food API key

## ▶️ Running the App

* **Web Client**: `cd frontend && npm start` ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

Ensure your React proxy (`frontend/package.json: "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"`) is set so `/api/*` routes forward correctly.
